With workshops **week 4** we launched an Hackathon for you to build real life applications with Apache Cassandra™. Idea is also to create altogether a database of sample codes.

# 1. What is the `ASTRAKATHON`

This is a contest that will last for 4 weeks where we expect you to code.

- Starting **July 22nd, 2020**
- Deadline **August 26th 00:00 PDT**

Pick the language your are confident with. 

Once done and winners announced and all source code will be **open source** for everyone to get it on a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/astrakathon)

No idea? Check this [data models collection](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/index.htm), pick one and make it fits Cassandra.

# 2. What do you win ?

Not only you will be part of the community but all participants will get a free copy of Jeff's book [Cassandra The Definitive guide](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1098115163?tag=duckduckgo-brave-fr-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)> real money to win and here is the 3 first places.

# 3. How are you evaluated ?

We will assess :
- **The data model :** choices and hypothesis
- **The source code :** quality and best practices
- **The ease of use (documentation, docker?)** - should be launchable in 5 mins per docs

# 4. Who will review my work ?

To review your submissions the commitee will be composed from:
- **The Developer Advocates team** at DataStax
- **Patrick Mc Fadin,** VP at DataStax
- **Johnathan Ellis,** CTO of DataStax, previous PMC of Cassandra project
- **Jeffrey Carpenter,** author of Cassandra the Definitive guide.

# 5. How to participate ? 

First you need to be registered to the [Cassandra Cloud Native Workshop Series](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cassandra-cloud-native-workshop-series-tickets-110114461318)

We have created an alias for your submissions : [astrakathon@datastax.com](#). You would provide code and documentations as an archive.
